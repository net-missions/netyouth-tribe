# Welcome to your Lovable project

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Supabase Server

Configure the Supabase MCP server via `.mcp.json` and environment variables.

1. Install dependency (already in devDependencies):
```bash
npm i -D @supabase/mcp-server-supabase
```
2. Set environment variable in your shell profile or `.env`:
```bash
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_supabase_personal_access_token
```
3. The `.mcp.json` is configured to run the server with `npx`.

To generate a Supabase access token, visit your Supabase account settings and create a Personal Access Token with necessary scopes.
